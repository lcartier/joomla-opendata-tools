=============

Annotator.js joomla plugin

_Usage_

- Install the plugin with Joomla plugin installer.
- Go to Extensions/Plugin manager.
- Search for "annotate" plugin, then go edit the settings.
- Set the div it to annotate
- Choose available options (local/remote files, minified or not)
- There is an option to load all plugin (according to annotate doc); one requirement, you have to register to annotateit.org. What might be a downside, in fact it is not, but I'm sure I'll read this in a mail : with all plugins loaded you will see a little toolbar at the top of the page...
- Don't forget to activate !
- Browse an article with content inside a `<div id="divtoannotate">`
